        <value>Hello, I'm a bot to mute users who don't have a username and block spammers and comes with various security features. Here are a few commands you can use:
1. /username (true / false) - To turn off or turn on the mute user feature if someone does not have a username.
2. /verify (true / false) - Users must verify when entering the group.
3. /time (int m / h / d) - To specify the time for all punishment.
4. /profilepicture (true / false) - To turn off or turn on the mute user feature if you haven't installed pp
5. /notif (true / false) - To turn off or turn on the private notification feature.
6. /settings - To adjust all settings.
